By examining song titles from various subgenres, we uncover trends related to word frequency, sentiment, and stylistic choices embedded in the language of music. Using tools like regular expressions, tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency), and sentiment analysis, we analyze how subgenres such as \"Hip-Hop,\" \"Pop,\" and \"Rock\" differ in their choice of words and the emotional tone conveyed through song titles.\n\nThis project aims to shed light on how language reflects the cultural and stylistic nuances of different music genres, providing insights into the connection between lyrical content, genre, and audience perception. Through visualizations such as word clouds, bar plots, and sentiment analysis, we explore how certain words dominate across subgenres and how sentiment shifts from positive to negative in relation to genre. Ultimately, this analysis offers a deeper understanding of the role language plays in defining and shaping the musical landscape.\n\n```{r}\n#| include: FALSE\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nspotify <- read_csv(\"https://joeroith.github.io/264_spring_2025/Data/spotify.csv\")\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| include: FALSE\n\nspot_smaller <- spotify |>\n  select(\n    title, \n    artist, \n    album_release_date, \n    album_name, \n    subgenre, \n    playlist_name\n  )\n\nspot_smaller <- spot_smaller[c(5, 32, 49, 52, 83, 175, 219, 231, 246, 265), ]\nspot_smaller\n```\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# str_count: Count how many words per title\nspot_smaller <- spot_smaller %>%\n  mutate(word_count = str_count(title, \"\\\\w+\"))\n\n# str_detect: Detect titles with numbers (e.g., \"7/11\")\nspot_smaller <- spot_smaller %>%\n  mutate(has_number = str_detect(title, \"\\\\d\"))\n\n# str_extract: Extract first word of the title\nspot_smaller <- spot_smaller %>%\n  mutate(first_word = str_extract(title, \"^\\\\w+\"))\n\nspot_smaller <- spot_smaller %>%\n  mutate(has_special_chars = str_detect(title, \"[\\\\(\\\\)\\\\!\\\\?]\"))\n```\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n# Unnest words\nword_data <- spot_smaller %>%\n  unnest_tokens(word, title) %>%\n  anti_join(stop_words)\n\n# tf-idf\nword_tf_idf <- word_data %>%\n  count(subgenre, word) %>%\n  bind_tf_idf(word, subgenre, n)\n```\n\n## Plot 1: Top tf-idf words by subgenre\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\ntop_tf_idf <- word_tf_idf %>%\n  group_by(subgenre) %>%\n  slice_max(tf_idf, n = 5) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(top_tf_idf, aes(tf_idf, reorder(word, tf_idf), fill = subgenre)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  facet_wrap(~subgenre, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(title = \"Top Unique Words in Song Titles by Subgenre\", x = \"tf-idf\", y = NULL) +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n**This plot shows which words are most important for each subgenre after removing common words (stopwords).

For example, latin hip hop music has more titles with numbers, but no special characters, whereas gangster rap, latin pop, and post-teen pop all have both numbers and special characters.**\n\n## Plot 3: Word cloud of the most frequently used words in titles\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(wordcloud)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(ggwordcloud) \n\n\nword_freq <- word_data %>%\n  count(word)\n\nwordcloud(words = word_freq$word, freq = word_freq$n, min.freq = 1,\n          max.words = 200, \n          random.order = FALSE, \n          colors = brewer.pal(8, \"Dark2\"), \n          scale = c(4, 0.5), \n          rot.per = 0.3) \n\n\n```\n\n**This plot is helpful for quickly grasping the most common themes in the song titles across the dataset.

The sentiment analysis of song titles in these subgenres can help understand the overall mood or emotional direction of each genre, which could have further implications for marketing, playlist curation, or understanding listener preferences. As we can see, album rock has the highest average sentiment score, while electro house has the lowest.**\n\n# Concluding Thoughts\n\nIn this analysis, we explored the linguistic patterns and emotional tones embedded in song titles across different subgenres using a variety of text analysis techniques. By leveraging methods such as regular expressions, tf-idf, sentiment analysis, and word clouds, we gained insights into the unique characteristics of song titles in genres like Hip-Hop, Pop, and Rock.\n\nFrom the tf-idf analysis plot, we observed that each subgenre tends to favor specific words, highlighting themes and stylistic choices unique to that genre. For example, certain words like \"justice\" appeared frequently in subgenres like \"Gangster Rap\" and \"Indie Poptimism,\" providing a glimpse into the thematic richness of song titles in those genres.\n\nThe bar plot showing titles with numbers and special characters revealed that genres like Latin Hip-Hop and Gangster Rap use numbers and symbols in their titles more often than others. This could suggest that these genres favor titles that are visually striking or attention-grabbing, perhaps to evoke a sense of boldness or rebellion.\n\nThe word cloud visualization further reinforced these trends by showing the most frequently occurring words in song titles across the dataset. Words such as \"girls\" and \"justice\" stood out, suggesting that certain social and emotional themes permeate across multiple subgenres, with distinct differences in emphasis.\n\nFinally, the sentiment analysis plot helped us understand how different subgenres convey emotional tones. Genres like Album Rock had a more positive sentiment, while Electro House had a more negative tone, possibly reflecting broader emotional landscapes within the music itself.\n\nThis analysis not only reveals how language shapes the identity of musical subgenres but also opens up discussions about the broader implications of lyrical content in influencing listener experiences, preferences, and even cultural perceptions of music. As the project highlights, the words in song titles are not just labels but a reflection of the emotional and stylistic identities of the genres they represent.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# From Lyrics to Language: Exploring the Textual Patterns in Song Titles\n\nIn this project, we explore the linguistic patterns and themes in song titles across different music subgenres using textual analysis techniques.
